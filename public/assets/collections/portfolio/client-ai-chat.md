In late June, 2020, I took on a contract through [Ettain Group](https://ettaingroup.com) to build a custom chat interface for a client's website to help assist customers with questions regarding their accounts and how they were affected by US government changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project has been a huge success and has been highlighted in an Ettain newsletter. Here is what they had to say about the project and how it has helped the client.

# Highlight in Ettain Newsletter

Greg Marine is a 6 month consultant with us and our client in Fishers, IN. In his role as Senior Software Engineer, he's assisting the client, a provider of student loan services, with an important project in response to US government deferred loan payments intended to help relieve the pressures on federal loan payments during the global pandemic.

To prepare the customer support center for managing the increased call volume without sacrificing service quality, the client wanted to provide customers a helpful and efficient self-service support option through their website. Under a strictly tight deadline of just 6 weeks, Greg was able to fully implement a micro service and chat-like user interface/experience to integrate the client's existing customer portal with IBM's CloudPak for Data SaaS product. The chat interface launches upon a customer interaction, which starts a session where the micro service loads customer specific data into IBM Watson Assistant. The User Interface (UI) allows the customer to chat with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in realtime and Watson responds appropriately to the dialog based on the customer's own data.

This invaluable tool has already serviced the needs of hundreds of thousands of customers making decisions concerning their student loans and has prevented a surge in call volume at the client's call centers. With Greg's help and expertise, the client achieved its very important goals.

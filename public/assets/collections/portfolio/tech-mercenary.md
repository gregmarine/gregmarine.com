I typically keep my son informed of what his father is up to. As I transitioned from being a corporate employee into contract work, I began to describe to him what freelance and contract work meant. I honestly thought I would lose him at some point with what I could only imagine to be a boring topic for a teenager. I could not have been more wrong. In fact, his response was, "So, you are a Tech Mercenary?!" I was so proud of his understanding of the topic that I have decided to use this concept in my branding.

# Tech Mercenary

So, what to me is a Tech Mercenary? It all started when I went from being a manager at Allstate Insurance and I went into contract work with their largest competitor, State Farm. Software Engineering is in my blood and I was ready to go back into it. Allstate was no longer the place for me and the company who hired me to do the contract work for State Farm loved the work I did at Allstate and were ready to take advantage of my insurance experience to help their client.

It is quite rare for a software engineer to stay with the same company for more than 5 to 6 years. It does happen. However, the only way for a company to hold on to talent is either costly or requires promoting them out of the job they love; which was always the case for me. I was often given raises to match my abilities until I was promoted into management. But at the end of the day, no amount of money given to me would help and I ultimately got promoted out of my happiness.

One of the benefits of working on contracts, freelance or otherwise, is how I am now able to not only apply my skills to help clients be the hero of their story, but at a cost at a fraction of the cost of hiring me as an in house developer. And as a bonus, my clients do not need to keep me busy to make it worth their while. It is up to me how much work I keep on my plate within the bounds of project deadlines. What this equates to is a happy developer who gives the client the best bang for their buck and time!

# Heros and Villains

As a Tech Mercenary, I am not the hero my clients need or even want. In fact, the hero is the client themselves! In almost every case, they do not need to be rescued from anything. What my clients truly need is someone who will empower them to do what they do best. Every company that has ever been successful is doing so because they already know what they are doing and are likely doing it well. Another way to look at is that their customers and clients see them as a hero. And those customers and clients will never know I am even a part of the story whatsoever.

So, what role does the Tech Mercenary play in the hero's story? My role is to create the tools the hero will use to meet the ever changing needs of their own customers. You can think of me as the Alfred of the Batman or the Q of the 00s in the James Bond films. Whether it be a customer facing website or app, an internal tool to help employees serve the customer, or a business to business integration between systems, I do the work that allows my clients to focus on being the hero.

The need to be a hero comes when there is a villain. So, who, or what, is the villain in my clients' stories. Typically it will be challenging software needs and projects. And every company knows what they need to do in order to succeed. The problem comes in how to solve those needs and in a way that isn't too costly in both time and money. This is where a Tech Mercenary comes in. Those villains do not stand a chance against the hero and their secret weapons built by the Tech Mercenary.

# The 4 Keys of Software Development

As part of my lifestyle, the Walt Disney World Resort and all things Disney plays an important role in the life of my family. In particular, Walt Disney himself is an inspiration both as a man and as a business person. That is the main source for the above "Heros and Villains" concept. However, there is also another key concept that I have adopted by Walt Disney. And that is his 4 Keys: Safety, Courtesy, Show, and Efficiency.

My good friend, [Mike Callaghan](https://twitter.com/walkingriver), wrote an [excellent article](https://walkingriver.com/four-keys/) on these keys and how they can be applied to software development. Here are the 4 keys as defined by Walt Disney:

1. **Safety** - *I practice safe behaviors in everything I do.*

2. **Courtesy** - *I go above and beyond to exceed Guest expectations.*

3. **Show** - *I ensure my area is show-ready at all times.*

4. **Efficiency** - *I perform my role efficiently so Guests get the most out of their visit.*

As part of his article, Mike (who works in software at the Walt Disney World Resort), translates this into how they can applied to software development as follows:

1. **Safety** - *I keep on top of and implement current secure coding, source code control, and data security practices.*

2. **Courtesy** - *I treat my users with respect, and consider their needs with every coding decision I make.*

3. **Show** - *I keep the user experience at the forefront of my application design.*

4. **Efficiency** - *I use my time, my team’s time, and the company’s resources wisely.*

I have adopted these keys and their software development definitions into my Tech Mercenary work. And in doing so, I help write the story my clients are a part of that defines their success. My clients need the safety of secure coding and data security, the consideration and respect their users deserve, the user experience their customers come to expect, and the best use of everyone's time and resources.

# Conclusion

This is being established as a living document here on my website as part of my portfolio. It will evolve over time and will always define how I approach software development for my clients. I also approach my own projects in this manor. I'm quite fond of stories and how they formulate over time. In fact, my own story has evolved over the course of more than 4 decades.

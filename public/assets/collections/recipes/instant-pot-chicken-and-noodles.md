# Overview

This started as a Christmas meal. It turned into a requested staple of my kitchen! And although I grew up having nice chicken and noodles from my mother's kitchen growing up, this isn't my mother's recipe! This homemade dish is full of flavor, texture, and all the love I can pressure into this Instant Pot meal! This is not only the best I could come up with, I honestly feel this is the best chicken & noodle recipe I have ever had.

# Instructions

1. Set Instant Pot to Saute mode (I set at least 20 minutes just to be sure)
2. Add butter and allow to fully melt
3. Add cream of chicken soup, broth, 1/2 tsp of salt, pepper, garlic, garlic powder, and seasoning. Stir until combined (I usually combine until it simmers)
4. Add the chicken breasts and cancel saute mode
5. Secure lid on the pot, set the steam release knob to sealing position
6. Press Pressure Cook button, set time for 12 mins on High Pressure (If chicken is frozen, set to 18 minutes)
7. Once the cook cycle completes, do a 10 minute natural release followed by a manual release
8. Once pressure is released, remove chicken and set aside
9. Press Cancel button to turn off the pot
10. Add frozen egg noodles to the pot and ensure they are fully submerged
11. Secure lid on the pot, set the steam release knob to sealing position
12. Press Pressure Cook button, set time for 6 mins on High Pressure
13. As the noodles are cooking, shred the chicken and season with remaining salt
14. Once the cook cycle completes, do a 5 minute natural release then do a controlled quick release of the remaining pressure
15. Add the chicken back to the pot and stir
16. Serve and enjoy!

# Notes

You can add a frozen mix of veggies if desired. If you do, add them when you add the shredded chicken back to the pot, let it sit covered for a few minutes to allow veggies to thaw, then stir and serve.

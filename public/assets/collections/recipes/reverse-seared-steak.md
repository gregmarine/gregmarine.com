# Overview

I've been cooking steaks for over 2 decades now. I have tried several techniques over the years with varying success. Then one day, my good friend [Michael Callaghan](https://twitter.com/walkingriver) [tweeted about giving reverse sear a try on a couple of bone-in rib eye steaks](https://twitter.com/walkingriver/status/1319372003145584641). I had never heard of it that technique. So I did a quick search. This recipe is the result of that search and many trial and error attempts at getting it just right.

# Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 225F
2. Salt and pepper both sides of steaks to taste
3. Place on a rack in an aluminum foil lined pan (shiny side up)
4. Roast for 65 minutes \[60C/140F\] (55 for medium \[54C/129F\]) \[These internal temps are lower than what the final will be due to the sear process below\]
5. Heat olive oil in skillet with medium-high heat
6. Sear each side for 1 minute
7. Reduce heat to medium-low heat
8. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter for each steak
9. Toss 2 gloves crushed garlic into butter for each steak
10. Cook for a few minutes each side, spooning garlic/butter over steaks
11. Let steaks sit for about 10 minutes for juices to settle

# Notes

For steps 8 - 10, you can also saute mushrooms and/or onions with the garlic and butter to top the steaks with something a little extra.

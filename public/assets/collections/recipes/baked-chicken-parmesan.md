# Overview

I use to judge a restaurant by its Chicken Parmesan. In fact, there are a few places, none of which can I even recall their names, I have not been to since having a bad experience with this dish. As 2020 was "that" kind of year, I decided it was time to develop my own recipe of my favorite dish. Here is that recipe!

# Overview

I use to judge a restaurant by its Chicken Parmesan. In fact, there are a few places, none of which can I even recall their names, I have not been to since having a bad experience with this dish. As 2020 was "that" kind of year, I decided it was time to develop my own recipe of my favorite dish. Here is that recipe!

# Notes

This serves 4, or 2 really hungry people. The first time I made this, it was only my wife and I. So we ate all 4 pieces of chicken and most of the spaghetti.

Substitute spaghetti for any pasta type, or omit the pasta if you prefer the chicken parmesan by itself.

For a low carb alternative, you can substitute pork rinds for the crackers and zucchini, or similar, noodles.

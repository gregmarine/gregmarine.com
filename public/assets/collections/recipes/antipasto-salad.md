# Overview

From time to time, we try to reduce the amount of carbs in our diet. This salad recipe is the result of the experimentation with creating a tasty meal with plenty of protein along with some flavorful vegetables. Eating healthy doesn't have to be bland. And this salad is anything but bland!

1. Place an even amount of your choice leaf on a plate (I love spinach or a garden mix)

3. Place generous amount of sliced banana peppers
4. On a cutting board, place the ham, then pepperoni, and then salami in 3 stacks
5. Roll each stack of meat and cut into small spirals (I usually get about 6 to 8 per stack)
6. Place the meat spirals evenly on top of the vegetables

8. Drizzle olive oil over entire salad as a dressing

# Notes

You can actually use any thinly sliced lunch meat and seasoning for this. The ones in this recipe are for an Italian style salad.

If you like pickled onions like I do, I highly recommend using those as a replacement for the chopped onion. Since I'm really the only one in my family that likes them, I almost always use chopped onions.

Any salad dressing is fine. The olive oil works great with this, however.

Feel free to sprinkle some salt and pepper on your salad for added flavor. I prefer not to. But like the pickled onions, it is a personal preference.

Toss some nuts and olives on this salad to make it next level!

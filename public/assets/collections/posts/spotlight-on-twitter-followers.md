Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on my Twitter followers!

# Twitter Followers

That's right, I'm back for another 2020 Spotlight. And this one is on the largest group of people in my life. And that is my Twitter followers.

I just want to shout out to them and thank them so much for the interactions that I've had over the last several months. And thank you so much for making 2020 much better than it could have been.

And some of the insights and suggestions and encouragement that I've received over these last several months has been all inspiring, and truly, truly something that will take me into the new year with a smile on my face.

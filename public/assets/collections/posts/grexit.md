I have worked professionally for over 25 years. In those years, I have worked for many companies and in many industries; serving most of them in the technology spectrum in one way or another. Most of the time, I have really enjoyed what I did for a living. And sometimes I did not enjoy it so much. I have worked for great companies with fantastic supervisors and with not so great companies for less than ideal supervisors. After nearly 4 years with a company where I began employment feeling it was one of the greatest companies, I found myself drowning in a toxic sludge that nearly destroyed me. But what happened that made it feel this way and what did I do about it?

# Two Guys From Indy

After my first marriage came to an end, I found myself in need of employment. The whole of the previous year had found me moving between a few companies and even between states. I had been laid off from one job in Illinois after leaving there for 4 years and was relocated by another back to Indianapolis. Our time in Illinois paid its toll on the marriage and the move back was not smooth. A few months after moving back, I was let go from the new job due to lack of performance. I had a hard time with the transition and the stress from the previous 4 years was a lot to handle. Shortly after this, my wife and I separated and our marriage never recovered.

This all happened in the fall of 2009. In December of that year, I landed a job that would change the course of my future. A couple of really awesome dudes had started a nice software firm in Indianapolis they aptly named [Two Guys From Indy](https://www.tgfi.net), or TGFI for short. They had just landed a lucrative contract with a large company with a rich history and they were looking for some developers to help serve that contract. My starting salary was quite modest and left plenty of room for me to prove myself a great software engineer. By the end of my first year with TGFI I was awarded with a 15% raise.

Another benefit for having such appreciative bosses with a lucrative contract is the company had plenty of extra perks. One of the best were the annual employee appreciation outings and dinners. There were at least 4 times where the company would take all employees and 1 guest to a restaurant at Christmas time where each plate was well over $100. Such places would include [Morton's](https://www.mortons.com) (Indy location now closed due to the 2020 pandemic), [The Capital Grille](https://www.thecapitalgrille.com/locations/in/indianapolis/indianapolis/8032), [Harry & Izzy's](https://www.harryandizzys.com), and [Ruth's Chris](https://www.ruthschris.com/restaurant-locations/indianapolis-northside/). And at each of these dinners, the company would give us a bonus based on our performance and how the contract was going. For me, this was typically in the thousands.

And if that wasn't enough, the company also paid the full premium for our health insurance! Alas, all good things come to an end. In 2015 that big contract came to an end as the client was consolidating their IT department. I continued working on other contract work until January 2016 when the company had to lay me off. It wasn't always the best work. However, it was by far the best company I have ever worked for. And although they eventually had to lay off their employees, I'm very happy the two owners are still in business today.

I have worked professionally for over 25 years. In those years, I have worked for many companies and in many industries; serving most of them in the technology spectrum in one way or another. Most of the time, I have really enjoyed what I did for a living. And sometimes I did not enjoy it so much. I have worked for great companies with fantastic supervisors and with not so great companies for less than ideal supervisors. After nearly 4 years with a company where I began employment feeling it was one of the greatest companies, I found myself drowning in a toxic sludge that nearly destroyed me. But what happened that made it feel this way and what did I do about it?

# Two Guys From Indy

After my first marriage came to an end, I found myself in need of employment. The whole of the previous year had found me moving between a few companies and even between states. I had been laid off from one job in Illinois after leaving there for 4 years and was relocated by another back to Indianapolis. Our time in Illinois paid its toll on the marriage and the move back was not smooth. A few months after moving back, I was let go from the new job due to lack of performance. I had a hard time with the transition and the stress from the previous 4 years was a lot to handle. Shortly after this, my wife and I separated and our marriage never recovered.

This all happened in the fall of 2009. In December of that year, I landed a job that would change the course of my future. A couple of really awesome dudes had started a nice software firm in Indianapolis they aptly named [Two Guys From Indy](https://www.tgfi.net), or TGFI for short. They had just landed a lucrative contract with a large company with a rich history and they were looking for some developers to help serve that contract. My starting salary was quite modest and left plenty of room for me to prove myself a great software engineer. By the end of my first year with TGFI I was awarded with a 15% raise.

Another benefit for having such appreciative bosses with a lucrative contract is the company had plenty of extra perks. One of the best were the annual employee appreciation outings and dinners. There were at least 4 times where the company would take all employees and 1 guest to a restaurant at Christmas time where each plate was well over $100. Such places would include [Morton's](https://www.mortons.com) (Indy location now closed due to the 2020 pandemic), [The Capital Grille](https://www.thecapitalgrille.com/locations/in/indianapolis/indianapolis/8032), [Harry & Izzy's](https://www.harryandizzys.com), and [Ruth's Chris](https://www.ruthschris.com/restaurant-locations/indianapolis-northside/). And at each of these dinners, the company would give us a bonus based on our performance and how the contract was going. For me, this was typically in the thousands.

And if that wasn't enough, the company also paid the full premium for our health insurance! Alas, all good things come to an end. In 2015 that big contract came to an end as the client was consolidating their IT department. I continued working on other contract work until January 2016 when the company had to lay me off. It wasn't always the best work. However, it was by far the best company I have ever worked for. And although they eventually had to lay off their employees, I'm very happy the two owners are still in business today.

# Dawn of a new Era

A few months after my time ended with TGFI, I was contacted directly over LinkedIn by the president of a small but mighty vending machine company located on the far Eastside of Indianapolis. I looked into the company and discovered it was the remaining entity from an Indianapolis dynasty in the vending machine industry started by a set of brothers decades before. Growing up near Indy, I was quite familiar with this history and I was excited to be contacted by them. I, of course, responded with my resume and a phone interview followed shortly.

The phone interview doing going as well as I had hoped due to a poor signal at the time. However, the Director of Technology decided to have me come into their office for a face-to-face interview in the second round despite that issue. This second interview went perfectly and I was offered a job on the spot. This seemed like a match made in Heaven. The excitement of landing this job with a company I was quite fond of that worked with some of the neatest technology was almost too good to be true!

As it is with most jobs, I started out with a lot of hope and vision of how I could improved the life of the company and its clients. In fact, I even put together a proof of concept for how we could build our mobile app in house for a fraction of the cost we were already paying a third party vendor. I put it together in just three hours! My supervisor was impressed, but he did not decide to bring the project in house after all. Shortly after that, he resigned. Not only was it puzzling why he wouldn't allow us to make the mobile app ourselves, it was equally puzzling he would resign so quickly after hiring a few of us.

Just before his resignation, one of the former employees came back as an Assistant Director of Technology. What we later found out was he was brought back to replace the Director. These chain of events quickly dissolved my excitement and I began to question if I had made the right decision to join the team. Me being me, I thought it was a good idea to do anything I could to help make things better. So I worked closely with the new Director to help implement his new vision. This went rather well and we are friends to this day. However, six months later, he too resigned.

# Rise to the Occasion

Against my better judgement, I threw my hat in the ring and offered my service to the president of the company as the new Director of Technology. He accepted on a trial basis to be evaluated the first three months of 2017. As you can imagine, I really shined in this new role and I was made officially the Director. This is when I began realizing why my predecessors left. However, once again, I thought it was a good idea to do anything I could to help make things better.

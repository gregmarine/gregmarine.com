Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on my friend, Mike Callaghan!

# Mike Callaghan
  
This 2020 spotlight is on my friend [Michael Callaghan](https://twitter.com/walkingriver). Mike is a software developer and the author of several video courses as well as books. This year he invited me to help him proofread and evaluate some of his [video courses, and also some of his books](https://gumroad.com/walkingriver).

And then in addition to that, he invited me to also write a guest chapter of ["Don't Say that at Work"](https://gumroad.com/walkingriver#ZONxF), as well as write the foreword for that book.

So thank you, Mike, for being a part of my year. And thank you so much for inviting me to be a part of your year.

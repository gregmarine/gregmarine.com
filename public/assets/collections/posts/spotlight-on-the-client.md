Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on the client!

# The Client

This 2020 Spotlight is for my client. I cannot name them specifically due to the contract type.

But they came at the perfect time. I started the year off without a job as I left a very toxic environment at the end of 2019. I did find new employment by March. However, I lost that position in June due to the pandemic.

I decided to go into contract work and landed my client a week later. The client has continued to extend the contract into the new year and I look forward to continue working with them.

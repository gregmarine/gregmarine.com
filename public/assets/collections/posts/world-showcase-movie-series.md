As a huge fan and frequent guest at the Walt Disney World Resort in central Florida, I was quite broken hearted when the gates closed on March 15, 2020. The months following brought news of Cast Member layoffs and when they reopened in July that year, there remained unanswered questions about when all of the magic would return. Stage shows, parades, and night time extravaganzas were all indefinitely postponed or completely canceled. Since I was not able to visit the most Magical Place on Earth between March and September in 2020, I had to find new ways to enjoy the magic at home. Thankfully, just before the pandemic took over the world, Disney+ was introduced. So, one of the ways I could enjoy the magic at home was what I call the World Showcase Movie Series!

# World Showcase Movie Series

On October 1, 1982, Epcot officially opened at the Walt Disney World Resort as the second park and first expansion of the resort. Although it was not quite what Walt Disney himself had envisioned for his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, one key aspect was implemented. As part of his vision, he wanted an international shopping center comprised of pavilions where the citizens of EPCOT could shop and enjoy culture from all of the world. When Epcot was finally designed and built after Walt's death, Imagineers created what is now known as the World Showcase. This multicultural market place surrounds World Showcase Lagoon and is the home to a permanent world's fair of 11 pavilions and 1 outpost.

I do not have many memories of enjoying the World Showcase from my childhood. However, as an adult, I have enjoyed visiting each pavilion, sampling the food, drinks, and culture, and interacting with the many Cast who are from each of the represented countries. And thanks to the many festivals Epcot has each season, the food and drinks vary throughout the year. So, regardless how many times I have visited each year, there is always something new. This has been Epcot one of my "must do's" on each trip.

Shortly after the resort closed in 2020, I had to quickly find ways of coping with not only the pandemic, but also the fact I had no idea when I would be able to visit the Walt Disney World Resort again. I really wanted to enjoy the Flower and Garden Festival as I had in years past, but the closing took place right as that festival was beginning. I knew without any doubt it would not reopen in time for me to enjoy it that year. One of the first coping ideas I came up with was the result of that timing. The World Showcase Movie Series is the idea of watching one of the Disney cartoons based on stories from each of the countries represented in the World Showcase pavilions.

The following are the pavilions and the movies I chose to represent each.

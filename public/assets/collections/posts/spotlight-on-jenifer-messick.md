Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on my wife, Jenifer!

# Jenifer Messick

This is my final but certainly not least 2020 Spotlight. And this one's on my wife, Jenifer.

Earlier this year her family had the COVID virus. I mentioned that before. But she also contracted it while taking care of some of her family members. During that time, it was very, I was very worried that she would pass away from it.

And thankfully she did survive and she does have some lingering effects that will last the rest of her life. But I'm very thankful that she's alive.

She's the one I watch TV with and, and the one that we dream about our future with. And so I just want to thank her so much for being a part of my 2020 and still being here to join me in my 2021.

Again, I want to thank you so much, Jenifer, for who you are and what you do in my life. And I just, I'm so glad and so thankful that you're still here with me.

I love you

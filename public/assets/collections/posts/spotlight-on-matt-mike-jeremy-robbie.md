Without a doubt, 2020 has been one of the most difficult years this world has faced in my lifetime. I'm closing the year out with some introspection and reflection on how 2020 has affected me personally. As part of that process, I'm doing a 2020 Spotlight to showcase individuals who have made a positive impact on me this year. This spotlight is on my friends, Matt Gilbank, Mike Vanderipe, Jeremy Cox, and Rob Malcahy!

# Matt, Mike, Jeremy, and Robbie

I'm back with another 2020 Spotlight.

This one is on a group of people I chat with on Facebook Messenger, Matt, Mike, Jeremy and Robbie. And I want to thank them so much for their part in this, this keeping me sane this year and some of the conversations that we have and some of the things that we share throughout those conversations.

They have, they've been people I can talk to, and they share some pretty insightful and wonderful things with me as well.

So thank you, Matt, Mike, Jeremy and Robby for being a part of my 2020 and looking forward to continuing those conversations in the new year.

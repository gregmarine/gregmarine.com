TJ Pataria  
I'm TJ, from Scotland, recent boot camp graduate. And they currently unemployed and looking for a job.

Greg Marine  
Well, congratulations on graduating boot camp. Tell me a little bit more about your background where you're coming from before you started to go into tech.

TJ Pataria  
So before tech had spent about 1617 years and worked in various roles in in retail retail management in the service industry. And one of these people who, who usually gets kind of not bored easily, but likes the keeps keep keep things fresh, if that makes sense. So that's Yeah. So yeah, I mean, in tech, it's interesting, because you're not always doing the same thing, right? It's not always the same remedial tasks they do. There's so many different technologies to work with so many different projects you can build. And so that's kinda how I landed in the lab of technology at the ripe age of just shy of 34.

Greg Marine  
Congratulations on getting to this point. So you started this year? I assume. So was it a part of the 100 days of code or anything like that?

TJ Pataria  
No. So weirdly, actually, um, so I grew up in the USA, Europe and scout when I was younger. Actually, I was enrolled in a course by my school, it was like a Microsoft program. And I actually started learning how to code when I was about 1415. Okay, but at the time, I didn't really enjoy it. So I was more into hardware and software. You know, I was one of these weird people who thought you know, software, it's, it's never gonna work. It's all about building computers. Right? That's right. That's where the money is. And I used to say, used to build people, you know, like, building computers from scratch. It costs like half the price, and I was in high school sighs making decent money on it. Oh, that's that. That's why late. That's why I enjoyed.

Greg Marine  
Okay, so you built computers, so that you did that? at the ripe age of 14? You said about 1415? Yeah, yeah. Throughout and throughout high school. Okay. Yeah, I used to build computers that one of my dad still using his computer that I built about 11 years ago now. So nice

TJ Pataria  
one, I still got one. And I built it's like a spider man themed one. Okay, it's for for it's tape. It's like top of the range. But I mean, eight Meg RAMs, nothing? is gonna do anybody any papers that are these?

Greg Marine  
Yeah. Well, that's the thing when you build them yourself. Not only can you do it for cheaper, you can use top of the line parts of the time box last last a lot longer. Yes, true. Yeah, very true. So. So tell me a little bit more about your journey this year through your boot camp, and, and all that.

TJ Pataria  
So recently, and when I say recently, in the last couple of years, I've been flirting with the idea of getting back into tech. And to be honest with you, if it wasn't for the pandemic, I probably wouldn't have gotten that push. It's just what the pandemic rate is, as most people know, there's so much more free time, you know, since I couldn't work, and you know, had to do something constructive with my team. And I kind of messed around on lane, you know, doing tutorials and stuff like that, and kind of was going around in circles. And I thought, you know, I'm just gonna want to Santa boot camp, I'm gonna get that structure, we're gonna get that help along the way. And then, hopefully, it should work. I did think though, at the beginning that the boot camp was going to be remote. So so I was surprised to learn that when, uh, when I enrolled, I got an email saying, you know, you're coming to your cohort in person.

Greg Marine  
Oh, really? Okay.

TJ Pataria  
And I was like, This is the opposite of what was gonna happen. But yeah, that was cool. Like, social distancing. And everything was practice on on campus. So they kept everything pretty clean, had to wear masks and shields and whatever, couldn't sit near anybody or whatever. So it was pretty cool. It was nice though to have like human contact after somebody myself. Yeah, I would say it of the people you live with.

Greg Marine  
And get out and get out of the house. Yeah,

TJ Pataria  
I'll get out of the house here. No traffic either, which was a bonus because no Nobody's going anywhere late.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, that's been one of the most eerie parts about going and traveling in the cities in the early months was there was no traffic.

TJ Pataria  
No traffic yet. That's Have you ever been to London?

Greg Marine  
No, I have not.

TJ Pataria  
No. So London is, I'd say, I've never been to New York. But what I see like, you know, in the media and like on TV and stuff, but in New York, the traffic's really bad. Right? London's all exactly the same. And then, my grandparents still live with me. They were they were stuck in India. And so they were coming back in April on like, government charge fleets. And then I went to pick them up. And I never in my life seen London that quiet. Like, it was really scary to see like, a quiet actually been. It kind of puts things in perspective, right? Like, absolutely. We're just

Greg Marine  
not the same. Yeah, and I never will be the same again, some things will be better. Now right now you guys are going through kind of another phase and other lockdown. Is that right?

TJ Pataria  
And yeah, so like Scotland's pretty, Scotland's been pretty strict compared to the rest of the UK through the process to be fair. And especially like the central belt of Scotland, we've been pretty much top tier of every variation of lockdown since it began. So it's not been fun. Well, I would say the one of my friends that day, like I've become really weirdly accustomed to just not doing anything anymore. And like to go out and do activities when things you know, get back to normal. Right. And it's actually more daunting than like staying at home for another seven months. Right.

Greg Marine  
So one of the things that you're hoping to do is get into a position where you're doing software development. Yeah, for something. So tell me a little bit more about what what kind of job you're looking for right now.

TJ Pataria  
And mostly anything back end? I'm not, you know, I'm wise to the fact that beggars can be choosers, though, right? And any experience just now is better than no experience. Right? So am I have a plan, whereas for the next few weeks, I'm applying to many roles that interests me before I kind of branch out and just start applying kind of not recklessly but right applying everywhere. And as opposed to being choosy about it. Yeah, that's probably I would prefer, I would prefer something back in or maybe even something kind of, you know, more driven towards data and stuff like that, because data and statistics, analytics, that kind of stuff always interests me, you probably seen on my term, massive sports fan. And I've been for many years and like more than actually playing. And I've gone through phases where like just just knowing the data, just knowing the statistics, and how to get them has been like more interesting than, than anything else.

Greg Marine  
Do you have any interest in like, machine learning or AI? Because that's, that's something that's a data driven, very much

TJ Pataria  
driven. I've actually got a couple of things lined up a couple of weeks short courses lined up over the next couple weeks to do and as a kind of an introductory thing to AI and ml. And so I think I'll enjoy it. Based on what everyone's been telling me, I hope I

Greg Marine  
so what software development languages and platforms? Are you working with them out of boot camp?

TJ Pataria  
So when we first jumped into boot camp, our first module was Python. Okay. And I dabbled in a bit of Python earlier in the year, so wasn't too unfamiliar with it. And actually really liked Python. And module two was JavaScript,

Greg Marine  
no fun.

TJ Pataria  
And that struggled with another lie, right? I still don't enjoy JavaScript, like if if I have to use it or use it. But after that came Java, and I was still not sure if I'm a Java fan, because I actually enjoy the language, or I just enjoy using IntelliJ. Yeah, there's half of the work for you. Right. But yeah, I'm a big Python. Finally, Python.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, Python is definitely the number one language for machine learning and AI right now. A lot a lot of it's really good. It's got a lot of modules for basically chunking around on that data. And it does it very quickly, and very efficiently. So

TJ Pataria  
that's a positive. Right? Yeah, absolutely. And

Greg Marine  
then you said, you've struggled with JavaScript, that's actually a common thing. It's JavaScript has been around since almost the beginning of the World Wide Web in the early 90s. It's evolved. It's gotten better, but at the same time, it's still quite challenging.

TJ Pataria  
Oh, yeah, I agree. It's, I mean, like, syntax is syntactically like, I'm okay. And it's just putting some things into practice. I struggle with sometimes even like, three fairly with some of the frameworks like view, kind of make it But easier, right and view I kind of, I kind of took too easily. And then we had only a couple of days of react literally two days just before a final project of react and as I struggled. And then once again, if you like view, you know, you love react and I'm still sitting there, you know, trying to work my way through this project. Thank you. Why don't I love this thing?

Greg Marine  
I've actually gone the opposite way. I've done Angular react. And then now view, I look at view as as much better like an evolution of the two, the other two, and they've fixed some problems. And to me going back to react, I struggle. It's like I I'd rather this would be easier in view.

TJ Pataria  
view. Yeah, actually funny you say that? Because a lot of my classmates actually felt the same way as though I think a lot more people enjoyed view than they did react.

Greg Marine  
Yeah. Yeah. And when I started in web development, it was around 90 9096. And there weren't any frameworks. And so I've learned all that. But now that the frameworks exist, I prefer the frameworks because mostly, because all of the the, all the gotchas with the different browsers. It's just they've solved all that in those frameworks. And that's why I prefer frameworks today.

TJ Pataria  
Anything that makes any job easier is always welcome isn't exactly what Yeah, yeah, it's good.

Greg Marine  
It's good to understand the fundamentals. But at the end of the day, you got

TJ Pataria  
it. It's like, why walk somewhere? If you can drive really what right? Maybe not if it's short distance, but if you're, if you're going somewhere, that's 50 miles away, you wouldn't walk there, you'd rather just cut out the riffraff and just just do the thing that makes things easier for you.

Greg Marine  
That's right. And technologies exist to make it easy. And now if a technology is the problem, then move on.

TJ Pataria  
Oh, yeah. Fair enough.

Greg Marine  
That's why I'm trying to get into view because I like view a lot better. It does everything. I mean, it does the same thing that Angular and react. does. But for me, it makes more sense. It doesn't.

TJ Pataria  
Yeah,

Greg Marine  
I would say better. That's it. Yep. So now, you, you mentioned you have mostly interest in back end, any interest at all in front end? Since we're talking about frameworks,

TJ Pataria  
I don't I don't mind doing front end work. But I just I genuinely prefer doing stuff from the back. Like I'm, I'm not, not like a relatively shy person. But I, in the same way with work as I am personally, like, I do like to keep things like to the background. So back in work just kind of suits me better. Not having to deal with, you know, where something's positioned on a piece as I prefer to work on, you know, the logic of why doesn't it just work in general? Why isn't it doing what it's supposed to do?

Greg Marine  
Right. So more business logic versus user experience on? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. No, that's good. And one of the problems with being a full stack developers, I've done it all. And so I say problem is because, you know, I wear many hats. And so it's better to target just a specific thing and get really good at that. So if you target back, of course, and you get jobs like that, then you'll just become an expert. Yes, go back in and take care of that. That business logic.

TJ Pataria  
That's the goal. That's the goal. I don't mind again, I don't mind full stack. It's just, I'd rather No, no,

Greg Marine  
I don't I don't blame you. And all these years, that's, I've stretched my, my knowledge, but at the same time, it's it all clashes inside my brain. Okay, how do I do this in C sharp versus JavaScript? You know, they're different frameworks or different languages. And so that's sometimes bounces around inside my head, takes me a minute to

TJ Pataria  
get it? Well, that's one of the things I learned along in my bootcamp journey was, you know, things aren't always going to be the same. And they, you know, Google is attains my best friend, but also things my worst enemy, so just, you know, be specific and be careful where you're looking for. Right? And

Greg Marine  
that's actually one of the differences between a junior developer and a senior developer isn't so much their knowledge of a specific framework or language. It's what they're searching for, you know, how can they formulate their query to be able to get the answer that they're looking for

TJ Pataria  
now? That's good. I hope that works out well for me, because based on what my classmates have told me, I'm a much better Googler than they are.

Greg Marine  
There you go. So you're already held that week. So you're already ahead of the game, then.

TJ Pataria  
Well, fingers crossed. I hope somebody else sees that when I'm applying for jobs.

Greg Marine  
Absolutely. Yeah. So good luck with that. I mean, one of the things you may have to encounter is, you know, coding problems and whatnot to to show that you have some skills. I think one of the things that the companies are looking for somebody that can find the solution to a problem, not necessarily exist. How, how you do it but more or less how you research it and troubleshoot it?

TJ Pataria  
Yeah, I've come across a couple of those already. I was doing one yesterday and I really stumped me. And on the there was two coding challenges in the interview. And I, the first challenge I got, I got 50% of the solution to work. And in the realm of running a team, the second one, I think I'd read 25 minutes, I just could not come up with solution even trawling the web just just couldn't find it.

Greg Marine  
Now, the good thing is, once you get in there, you won't we have a time limit once you have a job

TJ Pataria  
now, but yeah, it's a good thing. Yeah. Fingers crossed.

Greg Marine  
So you had mentioned your passion for hardware in the past. Now you've built computers now Do you have any sort of passion for you know, embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, or an Arduino or any of those?

TJ Pataria  
I don't am I actually stopped building computers, just after we moved back to Scotland, and probably are in all four or five. And the PI came a few years later than that. And then I remember I was working, I was managing an electronics place. And, and one of the guys that worked there, he'd ordered a Raspberry Pi and kind of Florida flirted with the idea of getting and I thought, you know what, I'm just gonna waste my money, because I'm not going to do anything with it. But recently, and I've been thinking about getting one and messing around with it. But I'm still on the fence. I'm not too sure.

Greg Marine  
One of the nice things about it is you get to dabble in both hardware and software and software. Yeah, yeah. So you get to do both. And it's all it's very little front end. It's all back end type back end coding. So because you're dealing with buttons and whatnot, but not necessarily a display. So

TJ Pataria  
I know I'm one of these people who if I if I can, like if I if I get it, cuz I can't get away something feasibly working on the first day, it's gonna like sit there and assaulted.

Unknown Speaker  
Oh, yeah, it's

TJ Pataria  
been a yearly thing. I should get a new one.

Greg Marine  
So who's your favorite sports team? I know you've talked about it on Twitter. But go ahead and tell my listeners here. My Seahawks

TJ Pataria  
on massive Seahawks fan? Oh, yes. The Seahawks actually aren't my first love. My first love. They don't actually exist anymore. Oh, they'd be the SuperSonics. But thanks to our shelves there. They're no longer a thing. So Seahawks was a close second. All right. The mariners haven't made the playoffs in years, so I just don't even don't even follow.

Greg Marine  
So that's the American football. What about, you know, actual football and soccer what we call soccer here.

TJ Pataria  
A Glasgow Rangers.

Greg Marine  
There you go.

TJ Pataria  
Classic Rangers. Yeah. Very cool.

Greg Marine  
Have you heard of them? Yes, I have.

TJ Pataria  
Yeah. It's a very contentious thing here though. Like he. And because there's only really two teams in Scotland. The main ones Glasgow Rangers and Glasgow Celtic. And it's pretty much split that in religious lines. Okay. So Rangers. They were, they were here originally. And then, when the Irish started to immigrate to Scotland, they weren't allowed to play with a lot of the other clubs and teams. So they created their own team called Celtic. So people always harp on that, you know, Celtic are the team of the immigrants. And I'm kind of the opposite of that. I follow Glasgow Rangers. Very cool. It's, it's like you, I always take a lot of people and because I was an Uber driver for a while, so people would always ask, you know, why do people people have asked us you know, what he used for me tell them and they get really angry. You know, it's, it's not something you want to talk about openly in this gray. Okay, kind of like it's kind of like skaaland shame. Like, it's pretty bad. can be pretty bad. Not everyone, it's getting better. No. And I think you asked a lot of people you know, why do you dislike this person? Just because they support it and they don't they don't even really No, it's just because the family have been that way for generations. That way so

Greg Marine  
yeah, we we don't have so much of that here in the United States. One of the things we do have rivalries but it's not like it's more fun than than anything there's not a whole lot of anger there.

TJ Pataria  
Yeah, I miss the I miss miss rivalry in the US it's a lot less intimidating.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, the only thing we have that are is more of a hatred is more Polish politics and stuff like that. Yeah, that's Yeah, that's definitely split here on that. But when it comes to sports, it's more fun than, than anything. So like my, my grandfather and my one of his sons, my uncle. They had rivalry teams. My grandfather was for green bay packers and my uncle's the Minnesota Vikings and so? Oh, yeah, yeah. So for a while they would have those little bickering fights, not just for fun, you know, but uh, but yeah, that's uh, that's something that's uh, I grew up with and it was kind of fun.

TJ Pataria  
Whatever you call it seemed the

Greg Marine  
Indianapolis Colts. Yeah, that's where I'm from. So

TJ Pataria  
I'll cool one of my cousin's is a cold fan. Although he's from Vancouver, BC. There we go. My dad was actually a redesign. Okay, cuz he's, so he was in LA when they were originally in LA. Yeah. And then they moved to Oakland. And when my parents got married, they moved to their original living in LA but then they moved to Stockton, California. So not far from Oakland. Right. And, and I think he always wanted us my brother and I to be like, prayer science, but I just never had. Yeah, it's just never was in me. I can see the appeal. A reader signs are nuts. But

Greg Marine  
yes, they are. very passionate.

TJ Pataria  
Yeah. That's when I started to like, enjoy sport. It was the Seahawks. I think it was about nine years old. Yeah. But 999 years old when I started properly get into sports, and it was all but the Sonics at a time, you know, during the NBA Finals and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. And then we just moved to Seattle. And everything was you know, obviously, you just couldn't top it for me at the time. You still can't know something. Yes.

Greg Marine  
I've never been to Seattle. I hear it rains a lot. But I've wanted to travel out there to Washington. So

TJ Pataria  
a bit say, Oh, yeah, it's bad in the winter. It's people think because I live in Scotland. The weather's worse here. But actually, I taste the opposite. The winters are harsher in in Seattle than they are here. It's cold here in the Bay here. But it doesn't snow. And we don't get storms like like we did in Seattle, because of the earthquakes here, which is a positive.

Greg Marine  
Oh, yeah. That's nice. Did you have many earthquakes when you live in California?

TJ Pataria  
And I don't remember we, we moved out of California when I was six, okay, six or seven. Like I was born in Scotland, okay, and grew up in California. Tobit, yes, six or seven. Then we moved to Scotland, then we moved to Seattle. And then when I was about 16 and a half 17. Then we moved back to Scotland. I was born here, because my mom was visiting her parents, okay. And when she found out she was pregnant, she was here and she wanted me to actually be born here. So I could have right both British and US citizenship. Right? And which I do so. Great.

Greg Marine  
So you're looking for a job right now? What other jobs have you been doing? I mean, before the pandemic, you said, you're in retail and all that. But um, what happened was that the pandemic that got you into this position where you're looking?

TJ Pataria  
So yeah, basically the two, three years before the pandemic I was a was a private hire driver. Okay, so you not do what to like mostly Uber or like my own private stuff. And, and when the pan I could tell just before the pandemic, I think it was around December, when the news broke of like, there's something happening in China. And then in January, it was like, it's actually starting to become a little bit of a worry for everyone else. February was, this country's now got it in their countries, but it's so like, around mid January pain, and I could tell something was off when things were really quiet, like, business wise. I'd never seen it that quiet. Yeah. And even the streets like around the city and the airports and stuff were really quiet. And you kind of got the sense that something was up. So like I said, like I had, I had been flirting with the idea for a couple of years of like maybe jumping into a boot camp or taking another route, maybe even going back to you know, your college or university. And, but it definitely was the pandemic that kind of pushed me to, you know, jump in with both feet. Because of the things that really get quiet and then and I'd stopped working around the third week of March. And technically, I mean, how it works since March 23. Actually, again, today's what December 23. So this will make exactly nine months. Yep. Yeah, nine months into this longest I've ever been to be here for was for just over four months, four and a half, maybe five in the in boot camp where everything has kind of been a blur. And because every time I say to people, you know, three months ago there, there wasn't any one single that was like eight months ago.

Greg Marine  
Yeah. It's been a crazy year. And the timeline you mentioned was kind of interesting, because here in the US most of the news didn't really break until late February, early March like in December. Nobody was talking about it here. And it turns out there was a lot of folks who were getting sick in November and December last year here in the US. Yeah, but we didn't know what it was. And then then by March, that's when everything released, got tore what you were saying kind of became quiet, you know, businesses started shutting down. And then by late March, we were full lockdown.

TJ Pataria  
So like, I, I read the news every night before I go to sleep, because it helps me fall asleep. Okay. So the way I have like, the tabs organized in the app is first of the World News. Okay. And then it's like, Asia, Pacific, you know, US and Canada. And then UK, and then more specifically, Scotland, in the west of Scotland, and then sports. And so yeah, I usually kind of catch on to these things before they kind of hit the mainstream, if you will. Okay, yeah. Just I'll see something. And I'm like, Oh, that looks interesting. See what it's about. And then monthly on the Yeah, I already knew, but it's because remembered a few weeks ago.

Greg Marine  
That's very good. And that's actually a good way to approach the news. Because by the time it becomes mainstream, there's a lot of bias in it. So it'd be better to read the earlier story. So that's a good idea.

TJ Pataria  
But I always remember what they say any other But yeah, I know I read.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, especially since you're using it to go to sleep. You might.

TJ Pataria  
That's Yeah. Positive and negative. Yeah. Well, that's

Greg Marine  
the cool thing about technology, though, is today we can organize our news that way. And that's one of the benefits I think in having a pandemic now is like we have all this technology that'll help us get through it you know, you you're doing you did the did the but boot camp and and everything. So like that help time go by faster, I assume, kind of gave you something to do while on lockdown. And I think a lot of people have approached this year, that way, you know, they make new hobbies and whatnot, too.

TJ Pataria  
I think so. Yeah. And one of my best friends is taking a boxing. Oh, nice. I don't think he ever would have if it wasn't for the, he's naturally quite sporty. Anyways, he does play a lot of football or soccer. And usually, like, in an organized team for the league. But boxing is something that's new to him, I don't I don't think he would have done it. If it wasn't something you can do on your own, right you don't need and you don't need a gym, necessarily. You can have any equipment at home and you can, you know, be up a bag in your kitchen if you want so. And I've got had other friends you know, upskilling into upskilling into other areas of relational learning new skills, and forging new career paths. And I would say to take as well, and for some people, because like I described the pandemic and it might sound odd to some people healing in this way, but as a blessing in disguise, right. And because if it wasn't for the pandemic, I wouldn't have had that kick up the butt to really, you know, get back into high gear and get going again, because it's not gonna live for a few years, I was kind of losing motivation. And then I was making okay money as a as a private hire driver. I'm not gonna, you know, pretend like I was grief stricken or anything I was I was doing okay, like, the money was good. It's just the hours were really long. And it was working almost seven days a week and like not being at work so wrong. Like if I ever came home and tried to relax. I just couldn't switch off. Oh, yeah. So now I'm like, I've learned to kind of just take it easy, a little bit. You don't take a deep breath, just walk outside, just chill out.

Greg Marine  
Right? I think that's been the take for a lot of people that I know is that they're learning how to relax, finally, because it's always been Go go go and the sheer. It's like hitting a brick wall. He stopped. What is he gonna do so?

TJ Pataria  
Well, that's it. Especially mentally, there's nothing more important than your mental health, your physical health, maybe, but your mental health is a big piece of who you are. Right? And you got to look after it. Whichever way you can. And you have to rest your brain from time to time. Like it's it's you just can't keep it switched on all the time.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, I'm hoping that, that me personally, I continue to use the new techniques of relaxing, going forward once this is all over. And we're kind of back to a new normal. Yes, that, that I can still take what I've learned this year to relax and continue to apply that in the future.

TJ Pataria  
What are you doing just now for your mental health yoga, hot yoga?

Greg Marine  
No, no. Both mostly what I'm doing is writing and doing like this part, this podcast. The nice thing about this is I'm getting out and talking to people that I wouldn't have. Otherwise talk to. And so I'm learning about backgrounds and about personalities from people all over the world. Like Like I mentioned, and actually the reason you reached out to me for this interview is I was already talking to folks all around the world. And you're like, Hey, how about you and I chat. And so this is a new thing for me. I'm branching out, I'm more of an introvert. I can, you know, talk to people, but this is a lot easier having a camera and a microphone to talk to people. So, yeah, this is one of the things that's helped me get through it. And again, writing blog posts and talking about my experiences and whatnot and sharing with the world. What I'm doing has been a big help this year.

TJ Pataria  
That's really cool. Cuz I'll be Honestly, I wouldn't have taken you as an introvert, you don't come across as one. So, you know, I don't know if you're masking it, or you just kind of jumped over that hurdle. But well, well done either way.

Greg Marine  
Thank you. Yes, it's much easier to be to seem like an extrovert. When on the computer, you know, I'm behind a keyboard and I talk about what I'm doing. But when I'm out and about, I don't necessarily talk to people to strange it. That wouldn't have ever known. I don't always just sit and chat with people.

TJ Pataria  
I'll tell you a funny story. Some I'm kind of the opposite. Like, I, I just when I'm I could be in the doctor's waiting or in a restaurant or a bar wherever they go. I always tend to strike up conversation with strangers basically, like, fly by myself, or you know, there's nothing else going on around us. Like it's it's awkward sitting in silence. Right. Right. And by famed like doing interviews on zoom, and especially job interviews, like I lock up quite a bit like I could feel myself like I start dripping in sweat. I get nervous. I'm stumbling over my words. I don't know what I'm talking about anymore. I start rambling. And then I look at them. And I'm just thinking, do you actually understand any of what I just said? Or are we both know very confused?

Greg Marine  
Yeah, I'm the Yeah, I'm the exact opposite on that. I'm more like that in person. Yeah, doing I've done interviews. You know, I've been in this business for almost three decades. And so doing face to face interviews has always been a what's been nervous, nerve wracking to me. Doing this all on a computer this year has been kind of nice.

TJ Pataria  
That's good.

Greg Marine  
Get to relax. But But yeah, like when I'm out and about, I like to people watch. If I go to a bar or something like that. I'm sitting by myself. And I'm watching other people and just kind of interacting in my head. And, like, I'll send a text back to my wife saying, hey, this person just said this funny thing. And I won't even acknowledge that to the person who said it.

TJ Pataria  
I've been there too, to be here. A couple of days.

Greg Marine  
Yeah. Yeah, recently went to back to Walt Disney World in Florida. And this is a couple weeks ago. And I'm glad the numbers are down, they've reduced how many people are allowed in the parks. So that's helped and everybody has to wear a mask, but it allowed me to sit and just kind of observe people without it being so chaotic. You know, there's not people going everywhere, like in the past where the streets of the the park would be packed. Now it's just you know, people here and there just kind of scattered throughout and distance and it makes it easier for me to observe those those folks.

TJ Pataria  
Oh, that's cool. How was the trip?

Greg Marine  
I was very good. It was very relaxing. did a lot of firsts. You know, I've I go to Disney World a lot. That was the first part of the trip. The second part of the trip, we actually went to the Florida Keys. And that's a set of islands down the South very southern tip of the continental US and I did some snorkeling around the barrier reef there in Florida, and then went out to a fort Fort Jefferson on the Dry Tortugas. It was just neat to see all that and since there's reduced numbers of people doing these things, it was just kind of nice to relax and it didn't feel like I was constantly bombarded with the virus. like everybody's distanced and so it was fun to do those also did jet skiing and never done that before and parasailing was fun. No lifting up, you know? 300 feet in the air. Yeah, yeah. And it was just it was really nice.

TJ Pataria  
I'm afraid of heights. I want to do parasailing Yeah, actually, like, like over water. I think it'd be more comfortable within like some like skydiving. Yeah. Oh, and I get really I get really weird. Like, even if I go up like an escalator, or even you know, you get like the glass elevators and you can Oh, yeah, yeah. And I always turn my back just so I can see smart my legs get really shaky and weird. And going up an escalator. I can't even look over the thing because I can't I just get really weird. I can fly no problem. They put me on an airplane 20 minute, window seat. Look, that is not an issue. It's just something like about being over war that's like really, really calming to me is like, oh, maybe I don't know if it's like a survival thing like that. I feel as though subliminally somewhere like, and I'm going to I'm going to survive if we hit war as opposed to crashing into a farm or field somewhere.

Greg Marine  
Right? My buddy I was with he has a fear of heights as well and he talked himself into going on the parasailing and he actually when we got up there. He was very real. So you know we're overwater, like you said, we weren't anywhere near land, you could see the island off in the distance. But when you're up there, it doesn't feel like you're 300 feet in, there's just sees nothing but ocean. So yeah, it's very common for him to

TJ Pataria  
the example I always give people the the best example, I was getting my fear of heights as the Space Needle in Seattle. Oh, yeah. Because as a child, when people used to visit, there's only a couple of places and see how you can feel them. The best place is the Space Needle. Because once you get to the top, you get a view of, you know, like the Puget Sound. And you can see the city and beyond, and you can see the mountains in the distance it as a really nice view from it, I won't deny that. The problem is once you step out, like once you take the elevator to the top, and you step out into the actual platform, it's slightly slanted. Okay? And, and you can feel a breeze. And it just kind of knocks me off balance. So what I do is, I kind of hug it inside real. And I look back like this now, and I kind of creep around and do a 360 tour. And then I go back and save. And you'll see people, the young kids, and they're laughing, and they're like, I can understand why it's funny. Because if I was a kid, and I seen a group, and instantly, it would be funny to me also. And but now I still I still leave when I'm back and to try and go by choice to like, conquer the fear. Because when I was younger, like I had to go up. And you know, because no one's gonna leave a 12 year old downstairs by themselves. Right? You know, I'll probably run off to the fear as opposed to anybody taking me. Because that's the kind of kid I was, and not run away, but you know, run off to the right. Right. So yeah, like, I've tried to do it. And the last time one of the Space Needle was actually one of my cousin's, and he's afraid of heights, though. I didn't realize until then that he's actually more afraid of heights than I am. And I see makes me feel better about my fear of heights. Because he just he just couldn't hack at all. Like, he pretty much almost passed out as soon as we got to the top. Oh, wow. It will, you know, we're trying to feed him beers Will you know, just relax everything we find just nothing works. Really, let's just go straight back. It was let's try something closer to ground level. That's right.

Greg Marine  
Now, that's the thing. There's nothing wrong with a fear of heights. Obviously, they've got it. You're not gonna fall out or anything. But I mean, it's a real thing. And I used to have a fear of like enclosed spaces. I used to be claustrophobic, you know, elevators bothered me, and everything. And I had to face my fears a few times, and that there were times when I'd be at the grocery store. Somebody would be on one end of the island, somebody would be on the other and then I'd be in the middle. And I would panic and want to climb over the over the shelves. Oh,

TJ Pataria  
wow. It's not like that anymore. No, no, you don't feel that way anymore.

Greg Marine  
No, I faced some other fears in my life and realized I can overcome that one because overcame the other fears that I've had. You know, I've been in places that just scared me to death. And I'm like, Okay, now I can handle elevators. That's cool, though. So yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's something that if you don't get over it, that's fine. There's nothing wrong with it at all.

TJ Pataria  
I'm a little bit better now. Well, I want to portray that a little bit better. Then Then I was before, and I like to feel that I have, but I guess I'll only know when I get to go back out into the world and try activities that can require me to be at height. Yeah. And as opposed to sitting at my desk talking about being a lot easier to do.

Greg Marine  
Exactly. And that's the thing this year, the pandemic has has been one of those things where you can, it gives you a kind of a chance to reset and face those fears. I mean, at first, the world was afraid of the virus, and it's still there, and we got vaccines and all that now, but the problems not over yet. So it's it's like, Okay, we got we still have some time to evaluate these kinds of things and, and figure this stuff out. And for me, I'm still continuing to face other fears, like, you know, talking to folks like said, I'm by nature, I'm an introvert. So trying to talk to new folks constantly is has been one of those fears that I've had, and I'm trying to overcome those this year, and hence the podcast. And so that's the nice thing about this pandemic is the positive is that we can face these kinds of things and get through it. You have to get together.

TJ Pataria  
Yeah, yeah, I agree. wholeheartedly. And like I said before, like I'm glad, like you feel comfortable. Well, I hope you feel more comfortable talking to people, strangers. Yes. I mean, you can talk to someone like on Twitter or you know, by email, but how much do you really know someone to actually get to write back and forth with them, like somehow, whether it's a phone or on a video conference or wherever?

Greg Marine  
Exactly. And that's, that's one of the things I've loved about doing this is, you know, back when I was a kid, you know, we dreamed about having video conferencing and stuff like that and it just wasn't a reality. Now, here, we are 2020 and this is the reality. You're in Scotland. I'm in Indiana in the United States. We're talking real talking. Yeah.

TJ Pataria  
And I said, I said that a few weeks ago, someone has a you know, if you, you said to me when I was even in middle school that and you know, I can live in one country, I can video calls somebody in another country, because I mean, video calls have been around for how many years now? and Apple had FaceTime since we're gonna see 1112 Yeah, someone? Yeah. And, you know, so like, I was in middle school and 9880. Okay, so like, if you had told me that 1314 years later, you could, you know, call someone across the world and see each other face to face like I really cannot get my face.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, yeah. And most of the listeners for this podcast will be listening to it via audio. But for those who are doing that, we're actually talking face to face via video cam. So

TJ Pataria  
I thought this was going, like as a video,

Greg Marine  
well, it will be on YouTube. But most of my listeners are on podcast like Google and stuff like that. My mom will actually be watching this on YouTube. That's her preference. So she will be seeing us. Hi, Mom. Yes. Hi, mom. So um, but yeah, that's, that's, that's the cool part about this. And, you know, I, I enjoy doing it. You know, look forward to continuing this in 2021.

TJ Pataria  
That's cool and long may be successful.

Greg Marine  
Yes, thank you. Do you plan to do other podcasts? One of the things I want to do as a Disney based one, since that's one of my passions is Walt Disney World and Walt Disney himself. And so I got a couple friends that, that we're probably going to be doing a Disney podcast next year.

TJ Pataria  
What can I what what is it that draws you into Disney? What's your favorite thing about Disney?

Greg Marine  
I think the biggest thing is that I don't feel like an adult there I go in and I feel like childhood memories just flood into my brain. And I can relax a lot of the trips I take there, I prepay everything, so I don't have to worry about money even while I'm there. I'm sure it hurts expensive. And I think about it before the trip. But once I'm there, that's out of my mind. Terribly fearful. And they they have this. They call it Disney magic. There's just something about the place that's different than any other theme park. Things happen there that don't happen anywhere else. All of the cast members are the people who work there. They're very friendly, and they answer all the questions you can ask them anything. If you have any problems, they'll take care of it. So it's just one of those places that's that embodies, you know, the spirit of relaxing. So speaking, Walt Disney himself is somebody I look up to his example. I don't know what he was like personally behind the scenes, but on the open a lot of his philosophies are things that I want to apply to my own life.

TJ Pataria  
Not fairplay. It's nice to have someone like that, that you can can look up to for ideas and philosophically where you said, and it makes, you know, walking down any new path that a little bit easier. Because you right, you have sort of a blueprint. And as a blueprint, yeah, kind of a blueprint to do things. And when you're down, you know, you go back and you're reading. Okay, so I can't do this. But how did he do this? Oh, he did it slightly differently. Maybe I'll try it that way. And that may work.

Greg Marine  
Exactly. Yep. So

TJ Pataria  
Disney for me is an odd one. Because I know I've been to Disneyland in California. And I only know that because I've seen it in pictures. But I don't actually remember being there. That makes sense. Yeah, I think I must have been around, or three, four or five. And I went by just I have no memories of it whatsoever.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, and I've never been to Disneyland itself. I want to get out there and experience that as well. But yeah, that's the thing when you're when you're that young pictures are the only thing you have and yet you may not have the memory appear until you've to go back it may trigger once you go back but but and that's what it has been for me like when I go to Disney World. That's where I went when I was a child was in Florida. And I walk in there and all sudden that memory that I had from when I was three or four floods into my brain. That's cool. So let's let's do this. It really is cool. In

TJ Pataria  
fact, that's actually really cool to you.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, so that's, it helps me and then now my share that with the kids. My son remembers his first trip to Disney World. And so every time he gets to go back, he'll say Hey, Dad, do you remember this? Do you remember that? It's a lot of fun.

TJ Pataria  
That's awesome. How old is he when he when he first when

Greg Marine  
he was six? So yeah, so he he remembers it really well. You give details that I that? I wouldn't think that a six year old would remember.

TJ Pataria  
You know what's funny, though, is in my family like we used to go to Reno I remember going to Reno a lot like I actually have memories From Reno, from being around the same age, I just have, I don't know if it's maybe I just didn't enjoy it. Maybe I wasn't well, but I do remember going to things in Reno, and you know, especially going to see the circus and stuff like that.

Greg Marine  
Oh, yeah.

TJ Pataria  
So not totally devoid of memories from that kind of age. But yeah, it's just it's the Disneyland one that always kind of, I just can't figure out why I don't know or why I can't remember it.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, it's interesting. You mentioned a circus. That was one of the childhood members. I remember. We had Ringling Brothers and Barnum, Barnum,

TJ Pataria  
Barnum and Bailey,

Greg Marine  
they would come quite often, I think they're, I don't think they operate anymore. But they, they would come here every year, and so my parents would bring us was Market Square arena at the time. And that place doesn't even exist anymore. Well, but um, Leah, those are some of the fondest memories I have of childhood as well as the circus. grayling brothers, I'm

TJ Pataria  
pretty sure I seen when I was in either middle or just entered High School. Yeah. And I think I won tickets through a raffle at school. Oh, that's pretty cool to go and watch. And yeah, even that circus in general, I don't know what they really operate anywhere anymore.

Greg Marine  
Now, they probably aren't right now, especially this year, because of the pandemic. There's data you can't do. Now, that's the thing. And I really feel for the for the folks who do the entertainment industry, because there's no longer movie theaters. Those have all shut down around here anyway. You know, sports, there's hardly anyone in the stands because of those same restrictions. And it's just, I can't imagine trying to perform and not have an audience.

TJ Pataria  
Yeah, it's even watching sport like from home. It's been really weird. And so I don't know if you follow soccer, football or soccer.

Greg Marine  
The American football I do when not, not sorry. Not, not international football.

TJ Pataria  
Nine international football. Yeah. Not the one you play with your feet.

Greg Marine  
Right. And the actual football.

TJ Pataria  
Yeah, seems to be fairly, I'll often have conversations, people are both football. And sometimes it can be misleading because I can mean one or the other. They can be they're both about it. Because that's just the way I grew up. Right. And but sometimes I forget, like I'm talking to you. And then I'm like, I better differentiate, you know, which one, sometimes with football. And I'm like mentioned teams, like the Seahawks and patriots, some people here get confused, because they're like, What do you mean? And same, like vice versa, like I'm talking to my family from North America, sometimes they confused. But the thing was, so like the English Premier League, one of the biggest leagues in the world rates, followed by millions all over the world. And so when they restarted the league had no fans obviously. And, and it was just really strange. And so what they started doing after a few weeks was they started using fake crowd noise,

Greg Marine  
right?

TJ Pataria  
Yes, in the broadcast, so you could watch it on one channel without the fake noise. Or you could watch it on the channel with the fake noise. And I couldn't watch it with the fake noise because it just, you know, the cheers were delayed, the boos were delete, and, and you could it just felt really fake. And whereas I kind of got accustomed to the no fans, because you can hear everything, you know, like them arguing, you know, what they're arguing about? why they're upset with their teammates, why they're upset with the opposition, what the coaches are saying. And so I find that really cool, but I'm actually glad because recently they've started letting I think it's around 1000 or 2000 fans back into the stadiums in England anyway is not in Scotland. And so there's a bit more of an atmosphere to the games, which had certainly been lacking during the year now, which I think most most people are happy about. But it looks like the UK will probably have to put that by once again for a few weeks. It seemed right. Well, this mutated stream of Coronavirus lingering around.

Greg Marine  
Yeah, I heard about that. And the fake noise did bother me at first to when I've watched the the opening game of the NFL this year, they had the fake crowd noise and it just didn't make any sense. I mean, the crowds were cheering for every play. I was like there's no crowds, and that play wasn't worth cheering about. So it was very distracting and I just couldn't watch it. And so it's much better without the the fake crowd noises now but but yeah, that's an I'm back to this. The second that new strand strain over in the UK. You know, I really that's that is devastating news and hopefully, hopefully they can squash that and hopefully it doesn't mutate other places as well.

TJ Pataria  
Then with the vaccine rollout, hopefully things will get there. And it's like the cold right there. There are many variations of the cold. There are many different treatments for it many variations of cancer, there are various different treatments for it. It's just to tame things. More than anything, right? Right. And I think as long as people managed to stay safe in, in the short term, and it'll be bad for the long term,

Greg Marine  
and stay patient, that's the thing with any of this kind of stuff we have to that's the other 2020 lesson this year is patience. You know, just

TJ Pataria  
patience it

Greg Marine  
take time, let it let things happen. Don't try to rush, anything, just be patient, and get through this.

TJ Pataria  
Like I said before, is everything got messed up? I feel like I've missed like, the second half of the year, because of boot camp. So for me, I guess I've kind of been patient but I like unwittingly. Right? And unknowingly. And but yeah, it's Yeah, it's, it's, it's the thing is like it is what it is at this. I know, there's a lot of people up in arms with things like for various different reasons. But it's it's a case of it as well as you know, make the best of the bad situation, which you would probably want to do in any situation, any of these right, you make the best of any situation that or any hand that you're dealt,

Greg Marine  
right. Absolutely. All right. Well, thank you, TJ for your time today. I appreciate this conversation and, and best of luck to you as you continue to explore technology and apply for those jobs for for software development.

TJ Pataria  
Thank you, Greg. I've had a blast. It's actually been really fun. It's my first hour, we've been taking on a stumbling thing again, this is my first time being on a podcast. And actually I thought was gonna be a lot more nervous than I was. Because like I said before the job interviews and stuff on zoom, I was sweating buckets, but I'm glad man, you made me feel really at ease. So appreciate that.

Unknown Speaker  
Thank you. Yeah, it's

Greg Marine  
been a great conversation, and I look forward to many more in the future.

TJ Pataria  
I hope to be on your Disney podcast one day.

Greg Marine  
Oh, yes, absolutely. Thank you for listening. This has been talking tech
